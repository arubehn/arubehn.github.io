Hi! I am a computational linguist, currently pursuing my PhD at the [Chair of Multilingual Computational Linguistics](https://www.geku.uni-passau.de/en/mcl/) at the [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de/en/). I focus on computer-assisted, data-driven methods for historical linguistics with the goal of advancing comparative historical linguistics by the means of intelligent algorithmic methods, alleviating researchers’ workload by processing large-scale data efficiently. I currently persue methods for modelling phonetic and semantic properties of basic vocabulary in an embedded space.

I have studied Computational Linguistics, General Linguistics, and Latin at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/). Within my MA thesis project I have trained a neural network that estimates global probabilities for arbitrary sound changes. Additionally, I have years of working experience as a software developer for EtInEn (Etymological Inference Engine), a software for historical linguists that is being developed at the [Linguistic Department](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/) in Tübingen.

## research interests

My research usually concerns the computational modelling of linguistic questions, especially within the domains of:
* historical linguistics
* phonetics and phonology
* lexical semantics and word formation
* typology

Instead of focusing on individual languages or families, I aim at developing "generalist" models and methods in the light of large-scale, cross-linguistic applications.
