Hi! I am a computational linguist, currently pursuing my PhD at the [Chair of Multilingual Computational Linguistics](https://www.geku.uni-passau.de/en/mcl/) at the [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de/en/). I focus on computer-assisted, data-driven methods for historical linguistics with the goal of advancing comparative historical linguistics by the means of intelligent algorithmic methods, alleviating researchersâ€™ workload by processing large-scale data efficiently.
