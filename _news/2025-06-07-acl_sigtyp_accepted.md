**Three accepted papers:** Very happy to announce that our paper ["Partial Colexifications Improve Concept Embeddings"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.09743) (with Johann-Mattis List) has been accepted for the main conference of the Association of Computational Linguistics. [Two more papers](/publications) that I have co-authored were accepted to SIGTYP.
